# Code Quiz (HTML/CSS/Javascript)

## Description
  I created a coding quiz for the user to test their base knowledge of Javascript. The program loops through each question slide using buttons powered by Javascript and the available multiple-choice answers using HTML radio buttons to check for user input. I learned how to apply a forEach loop, how to store the questions in a variable and parse them against the user's input, and how to show the user's score when finished.

This program presents a seven question quiz for the user to take. The user selects one of the available answers, then presses on the next button to be presented with the next question. Upon finishing the quiz, the user is presented with their score and the score is logged to localStorage.
